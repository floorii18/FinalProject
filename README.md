### Project description
This page serves as a demonstration of my studies and abilities and will be used as both a resume and a portfolio.

There will be public items such as skills and a brief overview of certifications, as well as private items like the description of experience and contact information.

Users will be able to navigate through the home page and use the search function to find specific skills. They can view the skills page classified into soft and hard skills, examine the details of certifications and experience, explore the "About Me" page, and use the contact form to leave a message. People who are not registered will only have access to the skills, the certification titles, places of employment, and the "About Me" page. To access the complete information, they need to register. The admin user can add, modify, and delete skills, certifications, and respond to messages left via the contact form.
